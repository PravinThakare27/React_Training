<h2><b>Lokmat Newspaper 1</b></h2>
<p>Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a
 magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national
 and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business
 and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology;
 sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. </p>
 
<p>Usually, the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labelled A, B, C, and so on,
 with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also
 feature an editorial page containing editorials written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing
 an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called "op-eds" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same 
 section as the editorial), and columns that express the personal opinions of columnists, usually offering analysis and 
 synthesis that attempts to translate the raw data of the news into information telling the reader "what it all means" and
 persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles that have no byline; these articles are written by staff writers.</p>
